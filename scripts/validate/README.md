# The validation suite

These scripts each drive a real pipeline end-to-end, proving a "done when"
criterion `make test` can't. See `CLAUDE.md` § Validating changes for real for
why they exist, and `docs/Decisions.md` §20 for why they're bash rather than Go.

Each is named for the **behaviour it proves**, not the issue that prompted it —
an issue number ages into meaninglessness. The originating issue is recorded in
each file's header comment and in its `VALIDATE_PROVES` declaration.

## Running them

```
make validate                     # the unattended subset — what CI runs
make validate-hardware            # needs the Incus remote and a real VM boot

./scripts/validate/run.sh --group compose
./scripts/validate/run.sh --describe            # the prerequisite matrix, live
./scripts/validate/run.sh --list --group compose --json
```

Any script also runs standalone and takes the same flags:

```
./scripts/validate/image-route-streams-seeded-image.sh --describe
./scripts/validate/image-route-streams-seeded-image.sh --strict --allow-skip base-image
```

## Exit codes

| code | meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | every check ran and passed |
| `1` | at least one check **failed** — a real defect |
| `2` | **hard** prerequisites unmet; declined to run at all |
| `3` | no failures, but at least one check was **skipped** |

The `2`/`3` split is the point of the harness. Before it, "you didn't install a
tool" and "the thing under test is broken" were the same outcome — #136 is what
that cost: a missing `go install` presented as five failures that read like a
node-provisioning regression.

`run.sh` aggregates: any `1` → `1`; else any `2` → `2`; else any `3` → `3`; else
`0`. "Something is broken" always outranks "something couldn't run", which
always outranks "everything that ran, passed".

## Skips, tags, and `--strict`

An unmet *soft* prerequisite produces a `SKIP` carrying a reason tag:

```
SKIP: image route returns 200 [base-image] — INCUSOS_BASE_IMAGE not usable
```

`--strict` turns any skip into a failure, except those explicitly allowed:

```
run.sh --group compose --strict --allow-skip base-image
```

That combination is what CI uses, and it is the suite's anti-rot mechanism. A
hosted runner genuinely cannot supply a 3.2 GB IncusOS image, so `base-image`
skips are blessed — but **any other** skip fails the build, including a *new*
tag nobody has blessed yet. A route that silently gains a precondition produces
a `FAIL`, not a quietly-tolerated skip, on the day it lands rather than weeks
later by accident (which is exactly how #107 broke four scripts).

Tags in use: `base-image`, `flasher-tool`, `incus`, `vm`, `github`, `upstream`
(the last meaning "a prior check already failed, so this couldn't run" — a
cascade, not a missing prerequisite).

## Prerequisite matrix

Don't maintain a table here — it would drift the moment a script changed, which
is the disease this suite exists to treat. Ask the scripts instead:

```
./scripts/validate/run.sh --describe
```

Each declares `VALIDATE_PROVES`, `VALIDATE_GROUP`, `VALIDATE_NEEDS` and
`VALIDATE_DURATION`; `--describe` prints them and exits without running
anything. Square brackets in `needs` mark an *optional* prerequisite whose
absence causes a skip rather than a failure.

## Groups

| group | what it needs | runs in CI |
|---|---|---|
| `none` | Go only | yes |
| `compose` | Docker, `docker compose` | yes |
| `incus` | an Incus remote | no — needs the host |
| `incus-vm` | an Incus remote, a real VM boot, `INCUSOS_BASE_IMAGE` | no — needs the host |
| `github` | authenticated `gh` with repo admin | no — opens real PRs, would recurse |

`run.sh` derives these from the scripts themselves rather than a list kept here,
so a new script is covered without editing anything central.

Target the Incus groups elsewhere with `VALIDATE_INCUS_REMOTE`,
`VALIDATE_INCUS_PROJECT`, `VALIDATE_INCUS_NETWORK` (#132) — needed to run on the
Incus host itself, where Incus is a local unix socket and no `homelab-host`
remote exists.

## Parallelism

`run.sh --jobs N` runs scripts concurrently. **The `compose` group cannot use it
yet**: those scripts share host ports 8080/3000/3100/9090 and a single Compose
project name, so two at once fight over both. The `incus-vm` group likewise
shares the `home-lan` bridge, and `app-produces-working-installer-e2e.sh`'s
header warns against running it concurrently with
`node-boots-and-trusts-bootstrap-cert.sh` for that reason.

Per-run isolation is tracked separately. Until then `--jobs` is safe only across
groups that don't contend — and the measured serial cost is low: the whole
non-hardware set runs in about two and a half minutes.

## The library

| file | contents | sourced by |
|---|---|---|
| `lib.sh` | counters, `check`/`check_json`/`check_eq`, `skip_check`, the prereq DSL, arg parsing, `summary` | all |
| `lib-compose.sh` | `compose()`, `wait_web_ready`, `wait_http`/`wait_json`, `check_log`/`wait_log`, `push_fleet` | `compose` |
| `lib-incus.sh` | `console_log`, `wait_for_console_text`, `incus_exec_bg`, `require_flasher_tool` | `incus`, `incus-vm` |

Two deliberate irregularities, both documented in the scripts themselves:

- **`multi-commit-pr-cannot-reach-main.sh` is fail-fast.** It drives one real PR
  through GitHub and each step depends on the last, so there is nothing to
  accumulate after a failure. It uses the shared recorders for output and exit
  codes but keeps its own aborting `fail`.
- **`cmd/validate-tunnel-harness` is a Go program.** It runs *inside* a container
  to drive create-instance from the node's side of the tunnel, which bash can't
  do from outside. It's a fixture the bash drives — the same category as
  `bootstrap` or `flasher-tool` — not a test. Go's layout requires it live under
  `cmd/`, so the suite is all-bash with one Go fixture binary.
